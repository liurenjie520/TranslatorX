            <p>Windows minidump files record the state of a program as it is running, or as at the moment of a crash. To
                read a
                minidump file, you must have the binaries of your application and the dump file.
            </p>
            <p>You can open and explore minidumps in GoLand. To open a minidump, navigate to <span class="shortcut">Run | Open
                Core
                Dump</span>. Specify paths to the executable and the dump file. Click <span class="control">OK</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Note: You can create Windows minidumps only on Microsoft Windows operation systems.
                But you can analyze and debug your application on all supported operation systems.
