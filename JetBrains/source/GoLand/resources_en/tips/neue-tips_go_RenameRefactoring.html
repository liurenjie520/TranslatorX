                You can rename any field, function, type, variable, package, or any other symbol at the caret by
                pressing
                <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:RenameElement;</span>
                (<span class="control">Refactor | Rename</span>). GoLand will update all references of the renamed symbol.
            </p>
            <p>Also, the rename refactoring renames methods declared in interfaces. When renaming such methods, you can
                choose to rename their implementations as well.
