                You can accept completion suggestions by pressing <span class="shortcut">Tab</span> instead of
                <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorEnter;</span>. In this case the suggestion replaces the characters to the right of the
                caret.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to accept suggestions is by pressing <span class="code_emphasis">!</span>. In this case the
                suggestion will be added prepended with negation, which may be useful for boolean expressions.
            </p>
            <p>
                To select different keys to accept suggestions, open settings <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ShowSettings;</span> and
                navigate to
                <span class="shortcut">Editor | General | Code Completion | Insert selected suggestion by pressing space, dot, or
                    other
                    context-dependent keys</span>.
