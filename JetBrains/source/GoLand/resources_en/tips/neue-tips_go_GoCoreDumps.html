            <p>Sometimes when you debug a program, you need to examine the code execution flow and understand the
                current state
                of a program. Go core dump is a file that contains the memory dump of running processes and their status
                during the life of a program.
            </p>
            <p>You can open and explore Go core dumps in GoLand. To open a Go core dump, navigate to <span class="shortcut">Run |
                Open Core
                Dump</span>. Specify paths to the executable and the dump file. Click <span class="control">OK</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Note: you can create Go core dump files only on Linux machines.
                You can view the dump files on any operating system that supports GoLand.
