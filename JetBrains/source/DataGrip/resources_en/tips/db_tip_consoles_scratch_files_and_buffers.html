            Database consoles
            are SQL files that are already attached to a data source. When you create a data source, a database
            console is created automatically. To open a console, right-click the data source and select
            <span class="control">Open Console</span>
            or press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditSource;</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scratch files
            are SQL files that are not attached to a data source. Refer to
            scratch files as temporary notes or drafts for some code ideas outside the project context. To create a
            scratch file, navigate to <span class="shortcut">File | New | Scratch File</span> (or press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:NewScratchFile;</span>).

            Scratch buffers
            are simple text files without any coding assistance features. Scratch
            buffers can be used for simple task lists and notes to yourself. There is no dedicated menu item for the
            action to create a new scratch buffer, but you can use the <span class="control">Find Action</span> popup (<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:GotoAction;</span>) and run the <span class="control">New Scratch Buffer</span> action.
